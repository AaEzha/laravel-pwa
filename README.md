# Laravel (PWA) Progressive Web Aplication 


This Laravel pakage turns your project into a [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).  Navigating to your site on an Android phone will prompt you to add the app to your home screen.

Launching the app from your home screen will display your app.  As such, it's critical that your application provides all navigation within the HTML (no reliance on the browser back or forward button).
